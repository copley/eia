"""
üì¶ This script pulls data from the EIA's Weekly Natural Gas Storage report via API.

What this script does:
- Connects to the EIA API (https://api.eia.gov)
- Retrieves **weekly U.S. underground natural gas storage levels**
- Starts from a user-defined date (currently set to 2025-03-01)
- Groups the storage data by weekly period (e.g., March 21, March 14, etc.)
- Displays reported values in **BCF (Billion Cubic Feet)**
- Sorts storage data alphabetically by region/description within each week

What this data includes:
- Weekly working gas in underground storage
- Regions such as:
    - East, Midwest, Mountain, Pacific, South Central, and Lower 48 States
    - Salt and Non-Salt storage breakdowns
- Reported values match what‚Äôs in the official **Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report** published by the EIA every Thursday

What this script does NOT include (but could be added):
- Historical comparisons (e.g., same week last year)
- Week-over-week changes
- Charts or graphs
- Export to CSV/Excel
- Price or production data

‚úÖ Summary:
This script is a direct line to the EIA‚Äôs weekly storage data. It prints a clear summary of how much gas is stored underground in each region of the U.S., broken down by week.

üõ†Ô∏è You can expand this to:
- Calculate weekly changes or YoY comparisons
- Visualize storage levels
- Filter to show only specific regions
- Add recent prices or weather overlays
