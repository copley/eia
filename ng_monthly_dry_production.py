üì¶ This script pulls data from the EIA Natural Gas Monthly report via API.

‚úÖ EIA production data is typically delayed compared to some other sources.
Here‚Äôs a breakdown of why and what alternatives you can use:

üïí EIA Data Delay ‚Äî Why It Happens:

1. Accuracy Focus:
   - The EIA prioritizes verified, reported data from operators and government agencies.
   - It does not rely on estimates or real-time sensor feeds.

2. Data Collection Process:
   - Monthly surveys are collected from energy producers.
   - These take time to compile, clean, and validate before release.

3. Publication Lag:
   - Most monthly production data (e.g., dry gas or gross withdrawals) is released
     1.5 to 2 months after the end of the reporting month.
   - Example: üìÜ December data ‚Üí published late February or March.

What this script does:
- Connects to the EIA API (https://api.eia.gov)
- Pulls monthly U.S. natural gas production data
- Filters to show only:
    - Dry Natural Gas Production
    - Marketed Production
    - Gross Withdrawals
- Prints only the latest available month ("front month")
- Displays U.S.-level totals only

What the full Natural Gas Monthly report includes (not covered here):
- State-by-state production
- Consumption by sector (residential, commercial, industrial, electric)
- Imports/Exports
- Underground storage levels
- Prices (wellhead, citygate, residential, etc.)
- LNG volumes and capacity
- Pipeline flows and capacity

‚úÖ So yes:
This script shows just the U.S.-level monthly production part of the NGM ‚Äî the same figures you'd find in Table 1 of the PDF/Excel report or on the EIA‚Äôs data browser.

üõ†Ô∏è You can expand this to:
- Compare multiple months (e.g., trends or changes)
- Include state-level breakdowns
- Pull in consumption or pricing data
- Export to CSV/JSON or visualize with matplotlib

üî• This is a great foundation to build your own energy dashboard or analytics pipeline.
